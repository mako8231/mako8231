## Hi There! Welcome to my profile!

Hello, I'm Masao Muraoka ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· (or just Mako ;) )! I'm 23 years old and I'm aiming to improve my skills to game dev's field. Currently on College Studying Computer Enginering, have a experience with python, C/C++, Golang, PHP and Javascript. I'm an aspiring artist (do not search!!!! :ghost:). My favorite game engine is godot! But currently I'm into studying SDL and OpenGL :wink:
